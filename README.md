# My15

This is a very simple technique to focus on **work** vs **play**.

- **work**: Anything you _have_ to get done next, even if you don't want to. While on the job, these are the annoying tasks of your job.
- **play**: Anything you _want_ to do, or even just getting up and walking around. While on the job, this could be pleasant job tasks.

## Rules:

  - between x:45 and x:59 o'clock, you can do whatever you want (**play**)
  - other times are reserved for **work**
  - except social, work etc. obligations
  - **work**ing is allowed during My15, but not vice versa

So it is like Pomodoro, but less fluid and with a longer work time. It does not require a timer, and it removes all choice.

You are giving yourself permission to **play** for 15 minutes (max), provided you **work** for the other 45. (And, yes, you know what task you have to do now. Just do it and get it over with. Yes, that thing you need to investigate for your task looks cool, so do it during **play** time.)

## Advantages:

- removes all choice, making it easier to comply
- not **play**ing on time just reduces **play** time
- more aware of current time
- more aware of time left for **work** or **play**, leading to greater efficiency (tiny deadlines)
- more aware of choices of play/chores
  - no mindless scrolling
  - more focus
- when you notice you're not working on **work**, you can tell yourself "only x more minutes and I can continue on this"
- easier to switch tasks after the break, so you can get small and big things done
- during the break you don't worry about work, which works calming
- during the break you are a step removed from work, allowing a fresh perspective
- can force meetings shorter, since you'll try to make them shorter to keep **play** time :-)

## Problems:

- you need to know what work is. For that, look at a system like [1MTD](https://www.michaellinenberger.com/1MTDvsMYN.html).
- you can still get distracted. Get into the [microhabit](https://www.jodymichael.com/blog/microhabits-small-mighty-agents-change/) of periodically asking yourself what time it is, and if you are correctly working or playing

## FAQ:

- Q: I can't concentrate, and it's still 30 minutes to go!
  - A: hang in there, keep **work**ing and worst case try **work**ing on another task. Make sure you take all your breaks so that you are rested and can focus.
- Q: I suddenly notice I'm not **work**ing when I should be!
  - A: Don't worry, ___forgive yourself___, start **work**ing and possibly reduce your **play** time a bit.
- Q: 25% of time **play**ing is too much!
  - A: the other 75% you're way more productive, and if needed you can do work or work-adjacent things during My15. Besides, you'll often miss the :45 mark, and that will shorten your **play** time.
- Q: I started My15 too late, can I start working later?
  - A: No. Better luck next break!

## Testimonials

- @wmertens: I suddenly had this idea of fixed break times and as soon as I started using it my productivity went way up. I'm very prone to procrastination, and asking myself "should I be doing this" used to get the answer "well, maybe", and now just glancing at the clock makes the decision very easy to do and to accept.
